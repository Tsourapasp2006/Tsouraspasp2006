# Tsouraspasp2006 ğŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm a first-year student at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Western Macedonia (UoWM), Greece.

ğŸ’¡ I'm just beginning my journey into the world of programming and engineering. Currently learning Python and exploring computer science, software development, and electronics.

ğŸš€ I'm working on small beginner-friendly projects to improve my coding skills and build a strong foundation.

ğŸ“š Always curious and open to learning new technologies, tools, and best practices.

ğŸ”— Stay tuned as I grow and share my progress here on GitHub!
